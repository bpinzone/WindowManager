    Put everything in virtual environment for portability. Put on pip.
    Make a function generator for the apple script interaction methods seen so far
    Add functionality to choose an app to bring fullscreen on retina display or center of big display

How the virtual environment was created
	pip3 install virtualenv
	x=$(which python3) # grab path for existing default python environment on computer
	virtualenv -p $x window-env # Make copy of environment, with self contained binaries.
	chmod +x activate
	# Edit the activate file so that line ~43 takes the path as the current working directory, not hard coded. Must activate when you're in window-env directory.
	Activate the environment with source ./bin/activate
	pip install shell
